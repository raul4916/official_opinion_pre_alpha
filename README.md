============

A Symfony project created on February 22, 2016.
This by no means is the final product and currently on pre alpha stage.  Currently wrapping up the database structure and now beginning to implement the libraries and the RESTful API.

Goals:

1. Finish back-end library for handling the database.
2. finish implementing the server-side RESTful API
3. begin implementing the client-side(deciding if I will be using a framework(i.e.:Backbone.js) or working without a framework)
4. implementing security measures within the website.
5. debugging and entering beta - By June
